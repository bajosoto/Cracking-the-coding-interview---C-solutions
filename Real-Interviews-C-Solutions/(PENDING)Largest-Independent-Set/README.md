# Largest Independent Set

Given a Binary Tree, find size of the Largest Independent Set(LIS) in it. A subset of all tree nodes is an independent set if there is no edge between any two nodes of the subset.

Example:
````
Consider the following binary tree. 

          10
        /    \
       20     30
     /    \     \
    40    50     60
         /  \
        70   80

The largest independent set(LIS) is {10, 40, 60, 70, 80} and size of the LIS is 5.
