# Stack of Plates

Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds soe threshold. Implement a data structure *SetOfStacks* that mimics this. *SetOfStacks* should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOFStacks.push() and *SetOfStacks*.pop() should behave identically to a single stack.
